# RTL_SDR-Graphs
This is a programme that will generate graphs from the rtl_power generated CSV file.
Using the rtl_power command prompt utility that comes with RTL-SDR devices, this code will generate a graph of the readings taken from the output. In this project,
the graphs are specific to the hydrogen line frequency and the output is generate by a radio telescope.
